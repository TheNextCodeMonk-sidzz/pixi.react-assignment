# Pixi React Assignment 

This project was created as part of a Pixi.js + React integration assignment.

##  Features Implemented
- Responsive PixiJS canvas with dynamic resizing
- Background rendering using `<pixiSprite>`
- Animated fish sprites using `<pixiContainer>` and `useTick`
- Asset loading using `Assets` from PixiJS
- Custom hook for screen resize handling

##  Work In Progress / Known Issues
- Displacement effect is not rendering properly (tried multiple filter implementations)
- Water overlay animation is coded but not visually visible in output
- Background scaling is over-stretched in some resolutions
- Due to deadline constraints, full polish is pending

##  Note
This was created for the Pixi React assignment.  
Some features are incomplete but core logic and rendering are functional.
